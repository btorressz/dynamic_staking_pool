# dynamic_staking_pool

## Project Overview

This is a **Solana blockchain** project built using the **Anchor framework** to create a **dynamic staking pool** where users can stake SOL tokens and earn performance-based rewards. Rewards are dynamically adjusted based on factors such as:
- The amount of tokens staked
- How long the tokens have been staked (staking duration)
- Early participation in the staking pool

> **Note**: This project is an example of work I developed for a client.

## Features
- **Staking**: Users can stake SOL tokens into the pool.
- **Rewards**: Rewards are dynamically distributed based on individual staking performance.
- **Claim Rewards**: Users can claim their rewards after staking for a certain duration.
- **Unstaking**: Users can withdraw their staked tokens from the pool.
- **Custom Reward Rate**: The initializer can adjust the reward rate for the staking pool.
